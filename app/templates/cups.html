			<h4>C - Cold Skin</h4>
			<p>Alcohol affects parts of the brain that maintain a healthy body temperature. Too much alcohol can stop this part of the brain from working and can cause your organs to shut down. People with alcohol poisoning can be cold to the touch.</p>

			<h4>U - Unresponsive</h4>
			<p>When a person has consumed so much alcohol that they canâ€™t function normally they may not be able to respond to anything. It's like alcohol anesthesia.</p>

		<div class="large-6 med-6 small-6 columns">
			<h4>P - Puking</h4>
			<p>Alcohol poisoning causes people to puke. Puking won't lower a person's BAC, but it can make a person even more dehydrated. Alcohol also inhibits a person's gag reflex. This might make a person choke on their own vomit or breath it into their lungs.</p>

			<h4>S - Slow Breathing</h4>
			<p>Alcohol also affects the part of the brain that regulates breathing. Breaths can become slow, shallow and irregular. A person may even have fewer than 8 breaths per minute. If a person isn't breathing enough, they aren't getting enough oxygen to their brain.</p>
